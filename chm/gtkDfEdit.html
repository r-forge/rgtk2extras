<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
gtkDfEdit is an RGtk2 based data frame viewer and editor megawidget intended to
be familiar to spreadsheet users and to form part of larger GUI projects. 
It provides a way to edit a data frame (see Notes for a description).
</p>
<p>
Changes made in the spreadsheet will appear instantly in the data frame. 
</p>
<p>
The "[" method is used for data-frame like extraction from the object. 
</p>
<p>
The "[&lt;-" method is used for assignment to the table.
</p>
<p>
The $getSelection method returns a list of selected row and column indices. 
</p>
<p>
The $getModel method returns the backing <code>RGtkDataFrame</code>.
</p>
<p>
The $getDimension method returns the backing data frame dimension.
</p>
<p>
The $getColumnNames method returns the column names.
</p>
<p>
The $getRowNames method returns the row names.
</p>
<p>
The $setColumnName(idx, new.name) method sets the column name at a particular index.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A GtkContainer containing the megawidget.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
The editor consists of row names, column names, the main grid of cells, and 
the left-hand corner cell. You can move around within the grid using the 
keyboard, the scrollbars, or by clicking and dragging with the mouse. 
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Navigation Around The Grid</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Keyboard navigation uses the familiar arrow or Shift, Shift-Enter, Tab, 
Shift-Tab, PgUp, PgDown, Ctrl-PgUp, Ctrl-PgDown, Home, End keys. These work
when either the grid or the column of row names has the focus.
</p>
<p>
Pressing a non-navigation key when the row names have focus will cause automatic
navigation to the closest match for the row name. The name matching entry dialog 
will go away after a couple of seconds.
</p>
<p>
Mouse navigation to a grid location can be done via the scroll bars on the grid
or using the scroll wheel.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Editing The Grid</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Using non-navigation keys in a selected cell will start editing within the cell.
If the column is of factor type, the cell entry will provide the user with an 
autocompletion containing existing factor levels.
</p>
<p>
Focusing out of the cell or pressing any navigation key will end the edit. 
Edited cell entries will be coerced to the column's data type, so alphabetical 
strings put into numeric columns will turn into a platform-dependent variant
of "NA". All character strings are stripped of beginning and end whitespace.
Adding a new item to a factor column will automatically update factor levels.
</p>
<p>
Deleting cells sets their contents to either NA, or "" if the cells are of type 
character. Deleting cell contents can be done in a number of ways. Deleting a 
block of selected cells on the grid can be done by selecting them, then 
pressing the Delete key. The Backspace key deletes the cell the cursor is on 
ignoring all selections.
</p>
<p>
Deleting entire rows and columns can be done by selecting the row names or 
column headers then pressing Delete, or else by right-clicking on the row names 
or column headers to bring up the context menu then clicking "Clear Contents".
</p>
<p>
Changes made in the data frame editor are automatically and invisibly updated 
so the R data frame object is kept synchronous with the grid display.
</p>
<p>
Ctrl-Z undoes any editing action on the grid. Actions that have side effects on
the data, such as coercion, are not fully undoable, which reflects the way R
handles these functions.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Editing Row And Column Names</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Double clicking row names and column names allows the user to edit them. 
Typing in the replacement name and pressing Enter, Escape or clicking somewhere 
else will set the changed row or column name. 
</p>
<p>
Duplicate row names will be turned into unique values by replacing each 
duplicate with the lowest possible ordinal number.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Editing The Data Frame Object Name</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
The name of the data frame object is displayed in the top-left corner cell.
</p>
<p>
Double clicking the top-left corner cell allows the data set to be updated and 
reassigned when Return is pressed. When editing is finished the data frame in 
the editor will be written to the new dataset name.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Cell Selection</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Active cells or cell selections are indicated with a focus rectangle. Active 
columns are indicated by a colored highlight. By clicking and dragging with the 
mouse, you can scroll around the grid in two dimensions and select a rectangular
block of cells. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard arrow keys with Shift 
held down to select a block.
</p>
<p>
Left-clicking and dragging on a region of cells selects the region and draws a 
focus rectangle around it. Selections are indicated by highlighted rows, column 
headers and a drawn focus rectangle. Rows can be selected by focusing on the 
row name column then doing either mouse or keyboard selection. 
</p>
<p>
The keyboard can also be used for grid selection. Left clicking on column 
headers or row names selects the columns or rows. Multiple, or ranges of, 
columns or rows can be selected using the usual Ctrl-Click and Shift-Click 
combinations.
</p>
<p>
Macintosh users should use Ctrl-Command-Click instead of Ctrl-Click.
</p>
<p>
Ctrl-A, or clicking the top-left corner cell, selects all cells on the grid.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Copying And Pasting</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Copied and pasted data is in tab-delimited form and can be pasted directly into
other spreadsheets or text editors. We use the usual platform specific line
separator.
</p>
<p>
In Linux, the functions <code>xclip</code> and <code>xsel</code> must be available at the 
command line for copy and paste to work. In Mac, <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code>
are used. In Windows, we use the R functions <code>writeClipboard</code> and 
<code>readLines</code>.
</p>
<p>
Ctrl-V pastes cell selections to the clipboard at the selected point into a 
block defined by the size of the pasted matrix and starting at the top left
corner of the top left selected cell. If necessary, this operation will change 
the dimension of the grid. Pasting automatically coerces data to the type in 
the column. 
</p>
<p>
Ctrl-C entered while focus is on the grid copies the selected block of cells.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively these functions can be accessed from the grid right click context 
menu "Copy" and "Paste". 
</p>
<p>
Copying a cell block into the clipboard will not include row or column names. To
include row and column names in the copy operation, select "Copy With Names" 
from the grid right click context menu.
</p>
<p>
Copying and pasting rows and columns can be done through the right click context 
menus over row headers or column headers in the "Copy" and "Paste" commands.
Copying from a column will include the column header and copying from a row will
include the row header. Pasting on columns will update the column headers.
</p>
<p>
Copying an entire data frame into the editor can be done through the grid top 
left corner right click selection menu through the "Paste..." command. This 
command brings up a global paste dialog which allows the user to choose 
whether the pasted data has row names and/or column names. When "OK" is pressed 
the data will be pasted in.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Data Coercion And Special Functions</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
From the right click context menu on column headers the selected data frame 
columns' assigned type can be changed. Available data types are Numeric, 
Integer, Logical, Character, Factor. Factor is a special enumerated data type 
(also known as a category) which can have its attributes set using the in-built
Factor Editor (see below). To coerce a data column, just open this menu and 
click the desired type.
</p>
<p>
The column context menu function "Set As Row Names" sets the
contents of the column as the data frame's row names. The menu function 
"Shorten Names..." replaces long string names with their unique abbreviations. 
</p>
<p>
Right clicking the top-left corner cell selects all cells and brings up a menu 
allowing global cut, copy, and paste actions. "Edit Dataset Name" allows the 
data set name in the R environment to be reassigned. "Default Row Names" sets 
the row names to their ordinal numbers from 1 to the number of rows. 
"Default Column Names" sets the column names to the familiar spreadsheet-style
defaults.
</p>
<p>
Coercion can be partially undone via Ctrl-Z, but to reflect R's handling of 
coercion, coercing between classes that are not interchangable, such as from a 
character to a numeric variable, is not undoable.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Inserting And Deleting Columns And Rows</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Right clicking on row name headers brings up a menu which allows Insert and 
Delete actions on data columns. "Insert" inserts a blank row before the row 
clicked. "Delete" deletes the selected row range and is not available when rows
are not selected. 
</p>
<p>
Right clicking on column name headers similarly brings up a menu which allows 
Insert and Delete actions on data columns. "Insert" inserts a blank column 
before the column clicked. To insert a blank column at the end, click the blank 
header at the right hand side. "Delete" deletes the selected column(s).
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Editing Factors</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
Right clicking on a column header of a factor column, then selecting 
"Factor Editor", or right clicking a selected factor column, opens the Factor 
Editor which allows factor levels, order and contrasts to be set.
</p>
<p>
The Factor Editor window displays the choice of data frame factor columns,
the factor levels of the selected columns, and the contrasts in the
"Factor Contrasts" expander. When a column is selected, if it is a factor, 
its levels are displayed in the "Factor Level Order" frame. The factor levels 
can be re-ordered, edited, deleted or additional levels added by using the
buttons to the right of the level display.
</p>
<p>
Factors are associated with contrast matrices for use in analysis of variance
and regression models. The Factor Editor allows contrasts to be set by opening
the "Factor Contrasts" expander frame and selecting the desired contrast type.
The default contrast type sets the first ordered level as the control.
</p>
<p>
It is often desirable to fill in factor levels according to a pattern, for
example, in specifying a balanced experimental design. This can be done in two
ways. First, highlighting a region of cells then right clicking on a Factor
column, pulls up the context menu including three options, "Fill Selected Down"
"Randomize Selected", "Fill In Blocks". 
</p>
<p>
"Fill Selected Down" fills all selected cells in the column with the FIRST 
selected cell. 
</p>
<p>
"Randomize Selected" replaces all selected cells within the column that was
clicked with the same contents, in randomized order.
</p>
<p>
"Fill In Blocks" opens a new window containing a spin button specifying the 
block size of factor level repeats to fill the selected region. For example, 
factor levels A, B, C, block size 2, the region is filled down 
A, A, B, B, C, C, A, A, B, B, C, C, etc. The region will be filled when the 
spin button is modified or Enter is pressed, and the fill can be cancelled by 
pressing Cancel. The OK button will cause the changes to be fixed.
</p>
<p>
The same factor filling options as described above can be accessed directly 
from the Factor Editor window, which can be called up as described above using
"Selected", "Random Fill" and "Fill with Replicates...". In this
case, it fills the entire column, not just the highlighted region.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>Sorting Data</STRONG>
</p>
<p>
From the right-click menu on the corner left hand cell or on the columns, the 
"Sort..." dialog can be opened. This dialog consists of (1) a "Sort Key" 
Selection frame (2) "Add/Remove Key" frame to add/remove sort keys (3) "OK" and
"Cancel" buttons.
</p>
<p>
Sort operations on the data can be undone via Ctrl-Z.
</p>
<p>
The "Sort Key" frame contains key choice items consisting of a combo box for 
key selection, radio buttons for coercion of the key, and radio buttons for 
choosing the sort direction. Sorting starts with the first key, breaking ties by 
keys further down the list. 
</p>
<p>
The combo box allows the user to choose the column of the data frame,
including the row names, they wish to sort on. 
</p>
<p>
The coercion radio buttons allow the user to sort on the corresponding column by
the default <code>xtfrm</code> ranking, or by first coercing to character or 
numerical form. This can be useful for sorting numeric row names or factors.
</p>
<p>
The "Ascending" and "Descending" radio buttons choose whether the sort on the 
corresponding key item is in ascending or descending order.
</p>
<p>
The "Add/Remove Keys" frame contains a button "Add A Key" allowing the user to 
add another key choice item to the "Sort Key" frame and a button "Remove A Key" 
to remove the last key choice item in the frame. There is no limit to the number
of keys that can be sorted.
</p>
<p>
Finally the "OK" button initiates the data frame sort and the Cancel button 
closes the dialog.
